# Case-Clicker
Welcome to Case Clicker, this is a silly game that I made for my friend's birthday. The concept is to click on his face to keep the affection meter high or else the game will end.

Feel free to try this game out for yourself [here](https://case-clicka.netlify.app/).

## Behind the scenes
For this project I took advantage of useEffect and the useState hooks inside of React. With these hooks I built my own timer hook, localstorage hook, and even a hook to manage the data of the perks. If you would love to discuss this further please reach out to me via my portfolio website [here](https://alancortez1337.github.io/portfolio/).
